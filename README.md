# Using Machine Learning to Predict the Weather
This project is based on a three-part article written by Adam McQuistan in [stackabuse.com](http://stackabuse.com/using-machine-learning-to-predict-the-weather-part-1/).

## Coming soon
I intend to predict the weather where I currently live (Round Rock, TX rather than Lincoln, NE). In addition to using Linear Regression as shown in the articles, I'll play around with other models (maybe neural nets?) and try to predict other outcome variables (such as precipitation rather than average temperature.)
